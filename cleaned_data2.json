Peerzada\n\nFounder and Managing Trustee\n\nThe establishment of LJ University is the apt culmination of the distinguished performance of LJK institutes in the area of higher education, especially professional education, over the last three decades. The LJ University will mark its presence with a focus on applied and skill-oriented education & research, innovation, entrepreneurship and outcome-oriented extension programmes. Professional education substantially enhances the productivity of the recipient of this education. So its cost, which is investment-in-self, should naturally be borne by the recipient.\n\nLJ University feels proud that, not only it participates in this programme, but also with the help of its highly qualified and committed faculty and other staff it is set to play a substantial role in nation-building under the able leadership of its Vice Chancellor, Dr. Dinesh Awasthi and the Directors of constituent institutes as well as the dynamic and innovative guidance of the Vice President, Dr. Manish Shah with the support of Board of Trustees of Lok Jagruti Kendra and other executives of LJ Pariwar.\n\nDr. Dinesh Awasthi\n\nVice-Chancellor, LJKU\n\nDear Students,\n\nThe past two years or so have been the most turbulent across the globe. This period was fraught with frustration, fear, and loneliness. This experience has been traumatic for elders and youth alike. However, the worst is over. Now we can see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNevertheless, the ingenuity of the human race has emerged as a victor. We have gained the confidence to surmount these upheavals. And if some rough edges are still left, Lok Jagruti Kendra University (L J University) is there to help smoothen them. The University offers a unique opportunity where in you can think beyond today. The place promotes critical thinking, sensitivity, compassion, curiosity and enthusiasm.\n\nThough of a recent origin as a university (only about three years old), our credentials are impeccable. When we were affiliated with other universities like Gujarat University, GTU, etc., our students had the proud privilege of obtaining most of the first 10 ranks, irrespective of their discipline, years after year. This has helped us gain the confidence of the students and their parents in our capabilities, and commitment to quality education. Every year, over 20,000 parents repose their confidence in us and send their wards under our care.\n\nThe major focus of the University is on promoting innovations and start-ups. We offer an environment where students can think beyond the obvious, out-of-box solutions. The University operates two well-managed incubators supported by Government of Gujarat. If you have an idea, we will help you materialize it. If you have a dream, we will help you realise it.\n\nThe University focusses skill development in a big way. For this purpose, we have developed an excellent interface with the industry and have partnered with Ford, Toyota, and Ashok Leyland in the auto sector, and companies like Zydus Cadila and INTAS in Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAll these achievements have been possible because of about 750 high-caliber faculty members that the University is blessed with. We are proud of our well- qualified and experienced faculty that will nurture you, guide you and mentor you. You are in safe hands.\n\nWelcome to L J University, shape your career, and live your dreams.\n\nDr. Manish Shah\n\nVice-President, LJK\n\nAt LJ University, we believe in sincerity and commitment. We work hard to achieve excellence. The LJ aims at the overall development of the students. We always try to offer professional and job-oriented courses. Ensuring accessibility to genuine opportunities for every common man. To democratize higher education is our core ideology. The ultimate objective of each of the University endeavours is to help the country achieve global competitive advantage.\n\nKeeping needs of the hour in mind, LJ University crafts its curriculum that is most relevant to the demand of industry and matches well with any centre of excellence. The University offers excellent, state-of-the- art facilities for high-quality education in the fields of Commerce, Management, Engineering, Pharmacy, Computer and Information Technology, Architecture, Planning, Design etc. Core strength of our university is its well-qualified and experienced faculty.\n\nThe prime motto of L J University is to provide quality education at affordable prices, without compromising intellectual excellence. We endeavour to ensure that no student, keen to study, is denied the opportunity just because he/she does not have financial resources.\n\nOur students are high performers not only in their studies but also in co- curricular and extra-curricular activities. There are no major tournaments organised by the affiliating universities that we had not won, or at least not had been the finalists. Recently (in the month of May 2022) the University organised pan Gujarat Volleyball and Basketball Leagues. We accomplished grand success in these leagues and were lauded unequivocally by the State Gujarat Volleyball and Basketball Associations. Besides games and sports, we also promote theatre and other cultural activities to develop the creative side of the students.\n\nWe also encourage our students to take part in social development activities like teaching children of poor and hapless slum dwellers, under PRAYAS, a development organisation run by the students. Similarly, we have established a \u2018Department of Happiness\u2019 under which about 300 ultra-poor are served food by the students, free of cost. Such activities not only make the students socially sensitive but also help them develop a well-rounded and balanced personality.\n\nI invite you to join the L J Family to pursue your career in excellence.",

The *theme for this year's women's day is EMBRACE EQUITY with the proclaimed symbol of Self-hug*. The term *\u201cequity\u201d refers to fairness and justice and is distinguished from equality: Equality means providing the same to all, whereas equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances*. The event was kick-started with an infotainment skit that *highlighted the keen issues faced by women such as Pay- role inequality*. It also portrayed the two sides of the coin,\u00a0 feminism & pseudo-feminism. The event was further glorified with the *speeches conveying a deep message about Body positivity and mental health*. The *dance & musical performance by the students encouraged the audience* to strive for their equity. *Students organized the games for faculties, non-teaching and cleaning staff.* The event was concluded with a strong message of Empowerment & Equity.\n\nApply Now\n\nFaculty Members\n\nRanking and Approvals\n\nPolicies &  Guidelines\n\nBest Practice/Pedagogy\n\nSyllabus\n\nMentorship Programme\n\nInnovation in Teaching & Learning\n\nExam Schedule, Results & Exam Policies\n\nResearch and Grants\n\nEvents\n\nAwards and Achievements\n\nActivities\n\nNewsletter\n\nPCI SIF\n\nAlumni\n\nPlacement\n\nHerbal Garden\n\nAudited Reports of Institute\n\nAdmissions\n\nGrievance Redressal\n\n#LJIP\n\nInternational Women Day",

Fluency Approach\n\n2. Foundational Approach\n\nThe students from English medium in schools obviously are fluent and more confident in speaking English language. However, this fact does not guarantee the fundamental knowledge of grammar and other rules for learning the language systematically. As the students of Gujarati medium in schools emphasize on the systematic way of learning the language, they give more time in studying the rules of grammar, spellings, punctuations, syntax etc. In the process of learning such complex rules of the language, they tend to remain weak in fluency. Gujaratis are blamed for having poor skills in English communication. This can be one of the reasons why there is no dynamic IT industry in Gujarat like Bangalore. This can also be the reason for poor ratio when it comes to passing civil service examinations. Then, why is it so that Gujaratis fail in smooth speaking of English even though they know the language better? And what can be done to achieve fluency of the language? Hera are some tips for gaining eloquence in English language.\n\nReading all the headlines and crux of the newspaper reports will surely build strong vocabulary. Try to read two full reports of your liking daily. Do not stop until you are confident enough to speak the language effortlessly.\n\nWe all have cable connection at homes. So why not utilizing it for skill-building? Watch HBO or other English movie channels at least twice a week. It will give you good listening practice.\n\nFind out such friends who also want to be self-assured in English speaking desperately. Decide with them the time, probably half an hour a day, when you will t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate only in English. In a few days, you will not have to struggle for finding apt words for your talks.\n\nWe all love cricket. Instead of focusing on watching cricket, one must pat heed to the way commentators speak and narrate the game. It is the most effective way of mixing fun with learning the language. Not only listen to the commentary, try to deliver it in your local games.\n\nWith the advent of social media, we have almost forgotten reading fiction. Do start it for the sake of learning the language.\n\nWe often call to the customer care for queries. Make sure that you speak in English. Let it be broken English but do not switch to other language.\n\nMost of us are crazy for watching web-series. We have our own favorite list for watching it. Make sure to add an English web-series to the list.\n\nIf you are beginner and want to improve your daily English conversation skills, these apps are really useful. These apps will help you learn English faster and better.\n\nIf you find this blog to be useful or you have any queries and suggestions for making English fluent, kindly mail me at hetaldoshi123@yahoo.com.\n\nSearch Course\n\nArchives\n\nJanuary\n\nFebruary\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nRecent Posts\n\nIn my career as an English teacher si\n                                            29 Dec, 2021\n\nCategories\n\nLanguage\n\nTags\n\nLanguages, Gujarati, English, Learning",

NewGen IEDC aims to inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the young S&T students, encourage and support start-up creation through guidance, mentorship & support. NewGen IEDCs would be established in academic institutions where students will be encouraged to take up innovative projects with possibility of commercialization. NewGen IEDCs would also spread the message of entrepreneurship and create a culture of entrepreneurship in the Host Institution (HI). With faculty already trained in the nuances of entrepreneurship, the presence of NewGen IEDCs in HI would create a vibrant entrepreneurial culture amongst the students.

How can we encourage\ninnovation and creativity in ourselves and our students? To answer this\nquestion LJ has been organising LJ Innovation Village, since 2013.\u00a0 Acting as a driving force in building the\nbackbone of the innovation ecosystem, LJ Innovation Village is a platform to\nshowcase innovative projects, products and start-ups by innovators from all\nover the country. It provides an opportunity to innovators to interact with\nstudents, faculties, industry experts and potential seed investors.\u00a0 The additions and deletions during this\nprocess ignite a creative instinct in the innovator. An innovative ecosystem is\nthe outcome of risk takers and entrepreneurial thinkers. Though innovation has\nbeen defined differently by coveted Nobel laureates, we believe that an idea\nmust be replicable and economically scalable. Innovation is a process, which\nevolves around the life cycle of a product/ service, from ideation phase to\ncommercialization for addressing a need of the society. In 2020 edition of\nLJIV, for the very first time a section named Brain-o-vation was introduced\nwhich rapidly increased the foot falls at the exhibition.

The review also discussed how to establish FDP, presented its ideal structure, features that make FDP effective, and outlined the barriers to its successful implementation as well as the future vision. This report also highlighted the situation of FDP in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the review concluded that professional FDPs produce promising outcomes in the learning and teaching practices and recommended that teachers in higher education should attend FDP training activities on regular basis and that the scope of planned FDPs should extend beyond the health professions discipline, to include social skills necessary for collaboration, professional growth as well as management, and leadership abilities.

Peerzada\n\nFounder and Managing Trustee\n\nThe establishment of LJ University is the apt culmination of the distinguished performance of LJK institutes in the area of higher education, especially professional education, over the last three decades. The LJ University will mark its presence with a focus on applied and skill-oriented education & research, innovation, entrepreneurship and outcome-oriented extension programmes. Professional education substantially enhances the productivity of the recipient of this education. So its cost, which is investment-in-self, should naturally be borne by the recipient.\n\nLJ University feels proud that, not only it participates in this programme, but also with the help of its highly qualified and committed faculty and other staff it is set to play a substantial role in nation-building under the able leadership of its Vice Chancellor, Dr. Dinesh Awasthi and the Directors of constituent institutes as well as the dynamic and innovative guidance of the Vice President, Dr. Manish Shah with the support of Board of Trustees of Lok Jagruti Kendra and other executives of LJ Pariwar.\n\nDr. Dinesh Awasthi\n\nVice-Chancellor, LJKU\n\nDear Students,\n\nThe past two years or so have been the most turbulent across the globe. This period was fraught with frustration, fear, and loneliness. This experience has been traumatic for elders and youth alike. However, the worst is over. Now we can see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNevertheless, the ingenuity of the human race has emerged as a victor. We have gained the confidence to surmount these upheavals. And if some rough edges are still left, Lok Jagruti Kendra University (L J University) is there to help smoothen them. The University offers a unique opportunity where in you can think beyond today. The place promotes critical thinking, sensitivity, compassion, curiosity and enthusiasm.\n\nThough of a recent origin as a university (only about three years old), our credentials are impeccable. When we were affiliated with other universities like Gujarat University, GTU, etc., our students had the proud privilege of obtaining most of the first 10 ranks, irrespective of their discipline, years after year. This has helped us gain the confidence of the students and their parents in our capabilities, and commitment to quality education. Every year, over 20,000 parents repose their confidence in us and send their wards under our care.\n\nThe major focus of the University is on promoting innovations and start-ups. We offer an environment where students can think beyond the obvious, out-of-box solutions. The University operates two well-managed incubators supported by Government of Gujarat. If you have an idea, we will help you materialize it. If you have a dream, we will help you realise it.\n\nThe University focusses skill development in a big way. For this purpose, we have developed an excellent interface with the industry and have partnered with Ford, Toyota, and Ashok Leyland in the auto sector, and companies like Zydus Cadila and INTAS in Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAll these achievements have been possible because of about 750 high-caliber faculty members that the University is blessed with. We are proud of our well- qualified and experienced faculty that will nurture you, guide you and mentor you. You are in safe hands.\n\nWelcome to L J University, shape your career, and live your dreams.\n\nDr. Manish Shah\n\nVice-President, LJK\n\nAt LJ University, we believe in sincerity and commitment. We work hard to achieve excellence. The LJ aims at the overall development of the students. We always try to offer professional and job-oriented courses. Ensuring accessibility to genuine opportunities for every common man. To democratize higher education is our core ideology. The ultimate objective of each of the University endeavours is to help the country achieve global competitive advantage.\n\nKeeping needs of the hour in mind, LJ University crafts its curriculum that is most relevant to the demand of industry and matches well with any centre of excellence. The University offers excellent, state-of-the- art facilities for high-quality education in the fields of Commerce, Management, Engineering, Pharmacy, Computer and Information Technology, Architecture, Planning, Design etc. Core strength of our university is its well-qualified and experienced faculty.\n\nThe prime motto of L J University is to provide quality education at affordable prices, without compromising intellectual excellence. We endeavour to ensure that no student, keen to study, is denied the opportunity just because he/she does not have financial resources.\n\nOur students are high performers not only in their studies but also in co- curricular and extra-curricular activities. There are no major tournaments organised by the affiliating universities that we had not won, or at least not had been the finalists. Recently (in the month of May 2022) the University organised pan Gujarat Volleyball and Basketball Leagues. We accomplished grand success in these leagues and were lauded unequivocally by the State Gujarat Volleyball and Basketball Associations. Besides games and sports, we also promote theatre and other cultural activities to develop the creative side of the students.\n\nWe also encourage our students to take part in social development activities like teaching children of poor and hapless slum dwellers, under PRAYAS, a development organisation run by the students. Similarly, we have established a \u2018Department of Happiness\u2019 under which about 300 ultra-poor are served food by the students, free of cost. Such activities not only make the students socially sensitive but also help them develop a well-rounded and balanced personality.\n\nI invite you to join the L J Family to pursue your career in excellence.",

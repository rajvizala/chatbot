However, this fact does not guarantee the fundamental knowledge of grammar and other rules for learning the language systematically.

This can also be the reason for poor ratio when it comes to passing civil service examinations. Then, why is it so that Gujaratis fail in smooth speaking of English even though they know the language better? And what can be done to achieve fluency of the language?

How can we encourageinnovation and creativity in ourselves and our students? To answer thisquestion LJ has been organising LJ Innovation Village, since 2013. Acting as a driving force in building thebackbone of the innovation ecosystem, LJ Innovation Village is a platform toshowcase innovative projects, products and start-ups by innovators from allover the country. It provides an opportunity to innovators to interact withstudents, faculties, industry experts and potential seed investors.
